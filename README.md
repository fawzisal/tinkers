# pan
A collection of scripts I made for my use when I couldn't find a published solution that I liked.

- **bin, bin_old,  bin_visual, binl**: for finding the most common words in a text.
- **def, rog, ety**: define words in the OED, Roget's or etymologyonline.
- **pan**: convert all files in the current directory (using pandoc, mostly).
- **pandoctor**: pretty-print pandoc input and output formats.
- **stamp**: add modified date to file's name.
- **timer**: turn down volume and sleep after x minutes.
- **bk**: lookup book metadata by isbn and rename file accordingly.
- **cpn**: copy a folder using finder (usually much faster than cp).
- **explode, implode**: split spreadsheet (ods/xlsx/xls) into csv files of its sheets; do the opposite.
- **monitor**: perform command every x seconds.
- **name**: rename file using its metadata (Author-Title.ext).
